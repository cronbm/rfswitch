         * By default, RFSwitch assumes that any signals it sends or receives
         * can be broken down into pulses which start with a high signal level,
         * followed by a a low signal level. This is e.g. the case for the
         * popular PT 2260 encoder chip, and thus many switches out there.
         *
         * But some devices do it the other way around, and start with a low
         * signal level, followed by a high signal level, e.g. the HT6P20B. To
         * accommodate this, one can set invertedSignal to true, which causes
         * RFSwitch to change how it interprets any HighLow struct FOO: It will
         * then assume transmissions start with a low signal lasting
         * FOO.high*pulseLength microseconds, followed by a high signal lasting
         * FOO.low*pulseLength microseconds.
